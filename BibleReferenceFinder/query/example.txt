1:43 The next day He purposed to go into Galilee and He found Philip And Jesus said to him Follow Me
1:44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida of the city of Andrew and Peter
1:45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph
1:46 Nathanael said to him Can any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip said to him Come and see
1:47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said of him Behold an Israelite indeed in whom there is no deceit
1:48 Nathanael said to Him How do You know me Jesus answered and said to him Before Philip called you when you were under the fig tree I saw you
1:49 Nathanael answered Him Rabbi You are the Son of God You are the King of Israel
1:50 Jesus answered and said to him Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree do you believe You will see greater things than these
1:51 And He said to him Truly truly I say to you you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man
